**Description:**

- As a user, I have the ability to add, delete, and change the name of a column.
- As a user, I can add a card with a name to a column and edit the card's name.
- As a user, I can open a card (in a separate window) and add/edit the main information (card name, card description, date by which the card should be closed).
- As a user, I can add a closing date to a card. Depending on how close the card is to the date, it changes color: yellow a day before the closing date, amber on the closing date, and red after the closing date.
- As a user, I can drag cards between columns and also change the order of cards in a column.
